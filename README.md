This repository contains simple python implementation of our paper [A2Net](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10034814).

### 1. Overview

<p align="center">
    <img src="assest/A2Net.jpg"/> <br />
</p>

A framework of the proposed A2Net. The temporal features are extracted from a registered pair of images by weight-shared MobileNetV2. Then, we use NAM to merge the temporal features within neighbor stages of the backbone to enhance their feature representation capability. PCIM is designed to capture the temporal change information from bi-temporal features at their corresponding feature levels. We stack SAM on each fusion of low-level and high-level features to polish the details of changed objects. Finally, a change map is obtained by gradually aggregating temporal difference features. <br>

### 2. Usage
+ Prepare the data:
    - Download datasets [LEVIR](https://justchenhao.github.io/LEVIR/), [BCDD](https://study.rsgis.whu.edu.cn/pages/download/building_dataset.html), and [SYSU](https://github.com/liumency/SYSU-CD)
    - Crop LEVIR and BCDD datasets into 256x256 patches. The pre-processed BCDD dataset can be obtained from [BCDD_256x256](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VrdQ-rxoGVM_8ecA-ObO0u-O8rSTpSHA/view?usp=sharing).
    - Generate list file as `ls -R ./label/* > test.txt`
    - Prepare datasets into following structure and set their path in `train.py` and `test.py`
    ```
    ├─Train
        ├─A        ...jpg/png
        ├─B        ...jpg/png
        ├─label    ...jpg/png
        └─list     ...txt
    ├─Val
        ├─A
        ├─B
        ├─label
        └─list
    ├─Test
        ├─A
        ├─B
        ├─label
        └─list
    ```

+ Prerequisites for Python:
    - Creating a virtual environment in terminal: `conda create -n A2Net python=3.8`
    - Installing necessary packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt `

+ Train/Test
    - `sh ./tools/train.sh`
    - `sh ./tools/test.sh`
